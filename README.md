# data-models
This repo consists of some data models and visualisations to gain insight into some of the works in mosaic.
The repo still needs cleaning and webapp alignment, but feel free to check some of the models in their raw forms here https://github.com/aorogun/data-models/tree/main/visualisations/plain%20models
once the webapp is up, a vivd explanation to setting it up will be on here.
